# ChatForms

**Turn AI follow-up questions into one-tap answers.**

ChatForms is an open-source SDK that lets AI assistants render **interactive form elements directly inside chat UIs**—buttons, dropdowns, and inputs—so conversations become fast, structured workflows.

Instead of asking users to type “A / B / C”, assistants can ask clearly and collect deterministic input.

---

## Why ChatForms?

Most AI chat experiences break down when they need structured input.

LLMs constantly ask questions like:
- “Choose one of the following…”
- “Confirm yes or no”
- “Which option applies?”

Today, users must type answers to questions that already have known options. This causes:
- Ambiguous responses
- Extra parsing logic
- Higher drop-off
- Slower workflows

**ChatForms fixes this by embedding real UI into chat.**

---

## What ChatForms Is (and Isn’t)

### ✅ Is
- A **frontend SDK**
- A **schema for structured replies**
- A **renderer for assistant-generated UI**
- A **state + serialization layer**

### ❌ Is Not
- A chatbot
- An LLM wrapper
- A hosted service
- A backend platform
- A “web3” thing

Bring your own LLM. Bring your own backend.

## Demo

The best way to understand ChatForms is to try the demo.

The demo shows:
1. An assistant message with UI directives (JSON)
2. The rendered chat UI users interact with
3. The final structured payload sent back to the assistant

👉 **Live Demo:** _(coming soon)_  
👉 **Playground Source:** `/playground`

## Installation

```bash
npm install @chatforms/react
```

---

## Basic Usage

### 1. Assistant returns structured JSON

This JSON can be generated by **any LLM**.

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "I need one more detail before continuing.",
  "ui": {
    "id": "priority_level",
    "type": "single_choice",
    "label": "How urgent is this?",
    "options": [
      { "id": "low", "label": "Low priority" },
      { "id": "medium", "label": "Medium priority" },
      { "id": "high", "label": "High priority" }
    ],
    "required": true
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Render the assistant message

```tsx
import { AssistantMessage } from "@chatforms/react"

<AssistantMessage message={assistantMessage} />
```

ChatForms renders the text **and** the interactive UI inline.

---

### 3. Serialize user selections on submit

```ts
import { serializeSelections } from "@chatforms/react"

const payload = serializeSelections({
  userInput: "This blocks a customer launch",
  selections
})
```

Result:

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "This blocks a customer launch",
  "structured_selections": {
    "priority_level": "high"
  }
}
```

This payload is what you send to your LLM.

---

## Supported UI Blocks (v0)

- `single_choice` (buttons)
- `multi_choice`
- `dropdown`
- `input` (short text)
- `confirm` (yes / no)

The system is schema-driven and extensible.

---

## Schema Overview

Each assistant message may include an optional `ui` block.

```ts
interface ChatFormBlock {
  id: string
  type: "single_choice" | "multi_choice" | "dropdown" | "input" | "confirm"
  label?: string
  options?: {
    id: string
    label: string
  }[]
  required?: boolean
}
```

See `/packages/core/schema.ts` for the canonical definition.

## Design Principles

- **Chat first** – UI enhances conversation, never replaces it
- **No auto-submit** – users always control when a message is sent
- **Deterministic output** – no guessing or parsing
- **Frontend-only** – no backend required
- **LLM-agnostic** – works with any model

## Roadmap (Non-Binding)

- More UI blocks (date, file, range)
- Framework adapters (Vue, Svelte)
- Optional schema validation middleware
- Analytics hooks (opt-in)

No auth. No lock-in.
